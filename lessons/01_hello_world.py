# Lesson 1: Hello, World! üåç

# Welcome to your first Python program!
# This is a comment - Python ignores lines that start with #
# Comments help us explain what our code does

# Let's make the computer say hello!
print("Hello, World!")

# The print() function tells the computer to display text on the screen
# The text inside the quotes is called a "string"

# Try changing the message and run the program again!
print("Hello, my name is [Your Name]!")

# You can print multiple things:
print("I am learning Python!")
print("This is so cool!")

# Fun fact: "Hello, World!" is traditionally the first program
# that people write when learning a new programming language!

# üéØ Your turn! 
# 1. Change "Hello, World!" to say hello to your best friend
# 2. Add a new print statement with your favorite color
# 3. Run the program and see what happens!
