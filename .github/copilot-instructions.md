- `turtle_art/` - Creative turtle graphics projects

## Learning Path
1. **Basics** - Variables, input/output, basic math
2. **Conditionals** - If/else statements, making decisions
3. **Loops** - For and while loops, repetition
4. **Functions** - Creating reusable code
5. **Lists** - Working with collections of data
6. **Turtle Graphics** - Visual programming and art
